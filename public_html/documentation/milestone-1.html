        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>One of the main things that I would like my PWP to accomplish is to assist me in getting a job that is not just a job, but a career.<br>
           I want my page to not only show that I have developed the skills needed to be a proficient developer, but to set me apart from competitors.<br>
           My PWP will highlight the qualities that make me a great team member, as well as a hard worker with a great work ethic.<br>
           When a potential job prospect views my page, they are gonna know that I am dedicated, hardworking, qualified and that hiring me would be the<br>
           best decision they could make for the job.

        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p> The audience that will be looking at my PWP will be potential employers. Be it a company, or somebody looking for someone to do freelance work.<br>
            These are the two types of audiences that I will be designing my page for. This could be a senior developer with a big company, or a small business owner.<br>
            looking to make their internet presence greater.</p>
