            One of the things that I would like to accomplish with my PWP is gaining full time employment.<br>
            I want my page to not only show that I have developed the skills needed to be a proficient developer, but to set me apart from competitors.<br>
            My PWP will highlight the qualities that make me a great team member, as well as a hard worker with a great work ethic.<br>
            When a potential employer views my page, they will be able to see that I am dedicated, I am hardworking, and thanks to my PWP I am qualified.<br>

             Project/hiring managers that may not be where I am from, trying to extract enough information to make an informed decision in a limited time frame. <br>

                Jacob Anderson is senior developer with a major non-tech-based company. This company has an extremely complex asset tracking system that spans over <br>
                mobile apps and webpages. His corporate level bosses are looking for a way to streamline communication within the company that has locations all over the country.<br>
                Jacob has been put in charge of this latest project. he was given full oversight on hiring the team that will need to build to complete that task at hand.

                <br>
                Not only is Jacob frustrated by the amount of responsibility that has been put on his shoulders, but he really doesn't have time to read through<br>
                a massive stack of resumes. Also, there have not been a good amount of options coming from where Jacob lives; so he is going to have to expand his search<br>
                for prospective employees to job search engines like linked in ect. Jacob hopes to minimize the time and maximize the results of his search by requesting his candidates<br>
                send him previews of their work, or some kind of portfolio. This will allow Jacob to not only learn about potential hires, but to see the quality of the work they have done in the past<br>
