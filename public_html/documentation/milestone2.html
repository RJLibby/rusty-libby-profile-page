<p>WELCOME: This will be a short greeting with a small introduction, also with a brief statement of purpose<br>
With a background image of my family and I.</p>

<p>ABOUT ME: This section will briefly highlight not only my technical skills that I have developed over the course of the bootcamp, but my professional skills as well.<br>I have a long history of being a strong employee, as well as a rich history in management. This section will be followed directly by a resume that can be downloaded.<br> I intend to lead into my resume with these different sets of skills fresh on the mind of a potential employer.

</p>GALLERY: I will have four mock up projects that I will include in this section. These will be simple but not so simple that my frontend skills are not adequately displayed. <br> I will include brief descriptions of each project to add context for the viewer of my page.<p>

 CONTACT: <p>This will be a contact form that will have all my professional contact information readily available.I will also include a link to my linked in profile, and my Git Hub profile for those are the only social media platforms I have.</p>
